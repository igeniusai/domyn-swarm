# Serving vs compute backends

:::{note}
"Backend" has two meanings in domyn-swarm. Serving and compute backends control
where models and jobs run. A data backend controls how jobs read and write data.
See [Choosing a data backend](../guides/data-backends.md).
:::

## Why two protocols instead of one backend type

A single `Backend` abstraction must serve models and run processes. These tasks
have different interfaces and failure modes. Separate protocols provide these
benefits:

- Serving and compute are selected independently. A model served in
  one place can be driven by work executing somewhere else.
- A new readiness strategy changes only the serving backend. A new process
  launcher changes only the compute backend.
- Endpoint readiness and job success remain separate states. As a result,
  `domyn-swarm status` can report a healthy endpoint and a failed job at once.

Both are `typing.Protocol` definitions. A backend conforms through its methods
and does not need to inherit a base class.

## ServingBackend

Owns the model endpoint and its lifetime.

| Method | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `create_or_update(name, spec, extras)` | Create or reconcile the endpoint and return a `ServingHandle` |
| `wait_ready(handle, timeout_s, extras)` | Block until the endpoint can serve |
| `ensure_ready(handle)` | Assert readiness for an already-created endpoint |
| `status(handle)` | Report a `ServingStatus`, carrying a `ServingPhase` |
| `delete(handle)` | Remove the endpoint |

`create_or_update` reconciles an existing swarm when you run `up` again. It does
not fail or create a duplicate swarm.

## ComputeBackend

Owns the processes that call the endpoint.

| Method | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `submit(...)` | Start a job and return a `JobHandle` |
| `wait(handle, stream_logs=True)` | Block until completion and return a `JobStatus` |
| `cancel(handle)` | Stop a running job |
| `probe(handle)` | Report a `JobProbe`, which is how `job status --refresh` works |
| `default_python(cfg)` | Interpreter to run the job with |
| `default_image(cfg)` | Container image, where the platform uses one |
| `default_resources(cfg)` | Platform resource request |
| `default_env(cfg)` | Environment the job needs |

The four `default_*` methods keep platform details out of the submission path.
The caller does not need to know that Slurm uses a `venv_path` and Lepton uses a
Docker image. `DefaultComputeMixin` supplies the common implementations. Most
backends can use its `probe` unchanged.

## How the two platforms satisfy them

Slurm uses an array job of vLLM replicas and an Nginx load-balancer job. An HTTP
probe calls `/v1/health` through the load balancer. Compute uses `srun` in the
allocation. `require_allocated_node` prevents work on the load-balancer node.

Lepton uses an endpoint that manages its own replicas. It polls deployment state
instead of an HTTP health endpoint. Compute uses a Lepton batch job.

The readiness strategies differ, but both implement the same protocol.

## Adding a platform

The protocols provide a small, closed list of methods. They do not require a
base class.

Each backend must still implement readiness, log retrieval, identifier mapping,
and cancellation. It also needs a configuration model with a `type`
discriminator. See `backends/serving/` and `backends/compute/` for examples.
