# Contributing to Domyn Swarm

Contributions should keep Domyn Swarm predictable for users and maintainable for
contributors. Keep each pull request focused and explain the behavior it changes
or preserves.

## Principles

- Start from the user-facing behavior and make invalid states difficult to
  express or submit.
- Preserve existing behavior and compatibility unless the change explicitly
  introduces a migration.
- Prefer direct designs, existing abstractions, and domain-specific names.
  Generalize code only when current callers share a real rule.
- Keep code, tests, documentation, and configuration descriptions consistent.
- Confirm that copied or adapted code is compatible with the Apache-2.0 license,
  retain required notices, and credit its source.

## Development setup

Domyn Swarm supports Python `>=3.10,<3.14` on Linux. Install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), clone the repository, and synchronize the
development environment:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Documentation work also needs the docs dependency group:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --group docs
```

Run project tools through `uv run`. When dependencies change intentionally,
update and commit `uv.lock`; otherwise leave it unchanged.

## Code and prose style

Ruff owns formatting and linting, and Pyright owns static type checking. The
repository-specific conventions are:

- Preserve public imports, serialized forms, CLI output, templates, and
  persistence formats unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Add Google-style docstrings to supported public APIs and non-obvious internal
  contracts. Do not add boilerplate docstrings to obvious private helpers,
  overrides, callbacks, validators, properties, or special methods.
- Comments are exceptional. Use one only when unusual code, a hidden invariant,
  an external constraint, a non-local side effect, or a non-obvious tradeoff
  would otherwise surprise a careful reader. Do not narrate straightforward
  code.
- Use concise active voice, US English, and sentence-case headings. Use “Domyn
  Swarm” for the project, `domyn-swarm` for the CLI and distribution, and
  `domyn_swarm` for the Python package.

Run the style checks with:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

## Tests and documentation

Run the closest tests while iterating, then the full suite before review:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -q --no-cov
uv run pytest
```

Changes to user-facing behavior require corresponding documentation. Build the
documentation with warnings treated as errors:

```bash
docs_output=$(mktemp -d)
DOCS_VERSION=latest uv run sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs "$docs_output"
```

Run every configured hook before submitting:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pull request guidelines

Open pull requests against `main` and keep each one centered on a single change.
Describe the motivation, observable effect, verification performed, and any
compatibility or migration considerations. Update tests and documentation where
the behavior requires them.

Use conventional commit messages. Every commit must be signed and signed off;
create commits with:

```bash
git commit -sS -m "type(scope): concise description"
```

See GitHub's documentation for
[configuring commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
