class DomynLLMSwarm(BaseModel):
    """Context manager orchestrating a distributed LLM serving swarm.

    Provides a unified interface for deploying, managing and interacting with a
    large language model serving cluster on a compute backend such as Slurm or
    Lepton. It handles the whole lifecycle from resource allocation to cleanup,
    with state persistence and job submission built in.

    A swarm consists of a load balancer (nginx) distributing requests, several
    vLLM server instances serving the model, a head node coordinating jobs and
    running user scripts, and persisted state enabling recovery and reconnection.

    On Slurm the swarm is deployed as a job array with roles assigned by
    `SLURM_NODEID`: node 0 runs the load balancer and the user driver, nodes 1
    to N run vLLM servers. Cloud platforms are reached through the deployment
    abstractions instead.

    State is persisted automatically - deployment metadata and resource handles,
    configuration, platform identifiers such as job IDs and node assignments, and
    endpoint URLs - which is what allows a swarm to be recovered after a failure
    or reattached from another process via `from_state`.

    Attributes:
        cfg: Deployment parameters, resource requirements and platform-specific
            settings.
        endpoint: Public URL of the deployed load balancer. Set once deployment
            succeeds through the context manager.
        delete_on_exit: Whether to clean up all allocated resources when leaving
            the context manager. Useful for temporary deployments.
        serving_handle: Platform-specific handle for the serving deployment,
            carrying metadata such as job IDs, node assignments and status.
        model: Name or path of the model being served. May be set after
            initialization to switch models.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If resource allocation fails; the message carries
            diagnostic information.
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: Propagated from a failed job submission.

    Note:
        The swarm must be used as a context manager for resources to be managed
        correctly. Startup waits up to `cfg.wait_endpoint_s` for the endpoint.
        Paths passed to job submission resolve relative to the execution
        environment, `ENDPOINT` and `MODEL` are set automatically for submitted
        jobs, and checkpoint directories are created as needed. Cleanup failures
        are logged but do not prevent the context from exiting.

    Example:
        Basic deployment, cleaned up on exit:

        ::

            cfg = DomynLLMSwarmConfig.read("config.yaml")
            with DomynLLMSwarm(cfg=cfg) as swarm:
                # Reachable at swarm.endpoint
                swarm.submit_job(my_job, input_path="data.parquet", output_path="results.parquet")

        Persistent deployment, reattached later from another process:

        ::

            swarm = DomynLLMSwarm(cfg=cfg, delete_on_exit=False)
            with swarm:
                pass
            # Resources remain allocated
            swarm = DomynLLMSwarm.from_state("my-deployment-abc123")

        Detached job submission:

        ::

            with DomynLLMSwarm(cfg=cfg) as swarm:
                handle = swarm.submit_job(
                    job=LongRunningJob(),
                    input_path="large_dataset.parquet",
                    output_path="results.parquet",
                    detach=True,
                )
                print(handle.pid, handle.external_id)

        Running a script on the head node:

        ::

            with DomynLLMSwarm(cfg=cfg) as swarm:
                swarm.submit_script(Path("analysis.py"), extra_args=["--mode", "evaluation"])

        Parameters
        ----------
        job : SwarmJob
            The job instance to execute.
        input_path : utils.EnvPath | str
            Parquet file produced by the upstream pipeline stage.
        output_path : utils.EnvPath | str
            Destination Parquet file to be written by *job*.
        num_shards : int, default 1
            Number of shards to split the input into. This is part of the
            checkpoint layout, so keep it fixed across resumes of the same job
            or previously-completed rows will be reprocessed.
        shard_output : bool, default False
            If True and `output_path` is a directory, emit one parquet file per shard using
            checkpoint outputs as the source of truth (supported by the polars runner).
        shard_mode : str, default "id"
            Sharding strategy for `num_shards` > 1 ("id" for stable id hashing, "index" for
            legacy row order sharding).
        global_resume : bool, default False
            When resuming a sharded job, filter inputs using global done ids across shards.
        detach : bool, default False
            If *True*, start the job in a new process group and return immediately;
            if *False* (default), the call blocks until completion.
        limit : int or None, optional
            Maximum number of rows to read from *input_path* — handy for
            dry-runs and debugging.  When *None* (default) the entire
            dataset is processed.

        Returns
        -------
        JobHandle
            Compute job handle with normalized status and metadata.

        Raises
        ------
