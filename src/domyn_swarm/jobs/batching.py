class BatchExecutor:
    """
    Executor for running tasks in parallel batches with retry logic and progress tracking.

    This class provides a robust framework for processing large collections of items
    in parallel with configurable concurrency limits, automatic retries, and batch
    checkpointing capabilities.

    Key Features:
    - Parallel execution with configurable concurrency limits
    - Exponential backoff retry logic for failed tasks
    - Batch processing with configurable checkpoint intervals
    - Progress tracking with visual progress bars
    - Optional callback execution after each batch completion

    Args:
        max_concurrency (int): Maximum number of concurrent tasks to run
        checkpoint_interval (int): Number of items to process before triggering batch callback
        retries (int): Maximum number of retry attempts for failed tasks

    Example:
        >>> executor = BatchExecutor(max_concurrency=10, checkpoint_interval=100, retries=3)
        >>> results = await executor.run(items, process_item, on_batch_done=save_checkpoint)
